# i3config
Configuration of my i3wm

For some reason tabs in vim on my computer and here on github look not quite the same.
I tried to make it more or less readable, but i don't really know how this would look
on yours if you woud want to clone this repo.

set_wallpaper.sh is a script that not only sets the desired image as a wallpaper but also
makes it a background image for i3lock in my configuration. It is achieved by creating a symlink
in your Desktop directory.
